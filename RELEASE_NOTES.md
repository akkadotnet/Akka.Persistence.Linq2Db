**Preview Release for Akka.Persistence.Linq2Db**

Akka.Persistence.Linq2Db is an Akka.Net Persistence plug-in that is designed for both high performance as well as easy cross-database compatibility.

This is currently marked as a preview release, with tests passing for MS Sql Server, Postgres, and SQLite. We are looking for community help with adding tests, as well as trying out the new plugin and [providing feedback](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.Persistence.Linq2Db/issues).

There is a compatibility mode also available for those who wish to migrate from the existing Sql.Common journals.

[Please refer to the project page](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.Persistence.Linq2Db/) for information on configuration.
